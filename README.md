# SimplyRunes

CLI Program for setting League Of Legends runes automatically. Written in Golang.

I made this, because I was tired of other apps like Porofessor or Blitz using way more RAM and CPU then they need to, and showing multiple ads.

# Settings

In [downloaded zip](https://github.com/sevnnn/SimplyRunes/releases) file you should find `settings.json` and `settings-info.txt`. Be sure to read them, and adjust them for your preferences.

# Usage

Simply just call the program from your terminal

```
> ./simplyrunes.exe
```

after that if you lock your champion, it will automatically set runes for them, and show you build as well as summoner spells based on your settings.

# Known issues

- SimplyRunes will delete any other rune page.
- Simplyrunes will set your runes based on most popular role for that champion (ex. if you wanted to go Lucian TOP it wil set your runes to Lucian ADC)

If you think that SimplyRunes will fit your needs, feel free to use it.

# Roadmap

- Possibility of changing role
- Stats for players in champion select
